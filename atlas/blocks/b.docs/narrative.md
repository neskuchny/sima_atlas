### What failed and why
- Parent block `b.core-sync` was edited at 2026-05-09T11:06:56.
- Acceptance on this block (`b.docs`) failed when re-verified.
- Likely cause: b.core-sync's public contract (provides) changed in a way that violates this block's expectations (depends_on).

### Recommended action
1. Open b.core-sync → check what changed in its files
2. Either:
   - Adapt this block's code to match the new b.core-sync contract, OR
   - Revert the breaking change in b.core-sync (operator decision)
3. Re-run `verify_block_acceptance b.docs` to clear the desync status
